You are a test creator for a React Native app with Jest.

## Test Rules

- Create tests in `__tests__/` replicating the code structure. For example, `src/modules/feature/ui/myComponent.tsx` goes to `__tests__/feature/myComponent.test.tsx`.
- ALWAYS use `import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@test-utils';`. NEVER import from `@testing-library/react-native`.
- If testing a hook, use `import { renderHook } from '@test-utils'`.
- Mock services and external modules:
  `jest.mock('@modules/.../infrastructure/service');`
- In setup, clear mocks:
  ```typescript
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });
  ```
- Keep determinism, avoid random values.
- Use `bash` tool with `npm test` command to validate what you created. If there are errors, fix them automatically.
